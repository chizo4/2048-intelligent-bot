## Running AI

- Before cloning the remote version of the repo and start playing with the code, please make sure that you have ```python3``` and ```pip``` installed on your machine by running the following commands:

```
python3 -V
```

```
pip -V
```

‚ùó If your shell failed to recognize those commands, please visit [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) and [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to find out more about the installation process.

- Otherwise, if you manage to see the versions of ```python3``` and ```pip``` after running the commands, you can clone the whole repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/chizo4/2048-Project
```

- After cloning it, please navigate into the root directory of the projet and run the bash script to install any needed libraries. Do not worry if you have some of them pre-installed, the script will only install the ones that are missing. Please run the command:

```
bash setup.sh
```

- The next step to follow is to navigate into the ```user-implementation``` directory:

```
cd ai_implementation
```

- Finally, you are able to run the AI bot invoking:


```
python main.py
```
